Description
In this project, I've created a blogging website where users can share their opinions on various global topics and current issues. Registered users have the ability to interact with these posts by providing reactions and comments.

Technologies used:
Python, Flask, Javascript, AJAX
MySql, Redis
RabbitMq, AWS S3

How to run the app:

1. Install all the required libraries from requirements.txt file using command: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install and run redis server on localhost and change the port according to your system in the app.
3. You also need to run the worker.py script in another terminal for the queue to accept the tasks and implement them.
4. Change the director to app where server.py is located.
5. Now to run the web app use the following command: python3 server.py
